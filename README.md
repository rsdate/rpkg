## Introduction
Rpkg is a simple package manager that eventually will be able to fill you package manager needs. Currently, it only has 3 commands, of which 1 is fully implemented, 1 is partially implemented, and one just runs the default behavior. This is version 0.0.1, so don't expect too much.
## Usage
Rpkg currently has 3 commands: `build`, `install` and `remove`. You can call those commands by typing `rpkg build`, `rpkg install`, and `rpkg remove`. The `--buildFile` option specifies what build file to use to build a package or build it while installing.
